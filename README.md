# KeplerImageViewing
I want to view some of the publicly available Kepler Data. This may just involve finding extant software.

## benmontet has a package f3
https://github.com/benmontet/f3  
This might be useful, and the readme shows how to FTP the full frame images.
The paper is also good. 

## Working Code
The `code/show_kepler_example.py` works.
